          tip: 'For maximum flavor, marinate the chicken for 2-4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. The acids in yogurt will tenderize the meat.'

          tip: 'The starchy pasta water is crucial for creating the creamy sauce - its starch content will help bind the eggs and cheese.'

The residual heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water gradually, 2-3 tablespoons at a time, until you achieve a silky, creamy consistency.',
