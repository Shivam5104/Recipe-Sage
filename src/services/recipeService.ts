        step: 2,
        instruction: 'Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Allow the oil to shimmer but not smoke. This indicates the proper temperature for searing.',
      },
      {
        step: 3,
        instruction: `Add the prepared ${mainIngredient} to the hot oil in a single layer. Do not overcrowd the pan. Cook without moving for 3-4 minutes to develop a golden-brown ${isVegetarian ? 'surface' : 'crust'}. Turn pieces and brown on all sides, about 8-10 minutes total. This browning step adds crucial flavor.`,

      {
        step: 4,
        instruction: 'Add the diced onion to the pan with the browned ingredients. Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion becomes soft, translucent, and lightly caramelized. The onion will pick up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.',

        instruction: `Add the minced garlic${isVegetarian ? ' and ginger (if using)' : ''} to the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes until very fragrant, stirring constantly to prevent burning. ${isVegetarian ? 'Add the garam masala or mixed spices and cook for another 30 seconds until aromatic. ' : ''}Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, adjusting to taste.`,
        tip: 'Garlic can burn quickly and become bitter, so add it after the onions have softened and watch it carefully.'
      },
      {
        step: 6,
        instruction: `Pour in the broth gradually, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. These bits add incredible flavor.

        tip: 'Let the dish rest briefly before serving - this allows the flavors to meld and the temperature to even out.'
